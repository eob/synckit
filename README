Welcome to Sync Kit!
=====================

Thank you for downloading Sync Kit. Sync Kit is a web library that makes use
of a browser's database to offload data storage and processing tasks from 
a web server into the client. Doing so boosts the performance of your web 
application. For feed-heavy sites such as blogs, Sync Kit can boost your 
server throughput by a factor of four.

We're working on uploading some runable demos of Sync Kit right now, but
in the meantime you can enjoy our paper on Sync Kit:
